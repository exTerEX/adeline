# Adeline

A simple implementation of Adaptive Linear Element (AdeLinE), an early single-layer artificial neural network.

The output of the network is

$$ y = \sum\limits_{j=1}^n x_jw_j+\theta$$

Where,
- $x$ is the input vector
- $w$ is the weight vector
- $n$ is the number of inputs
- $\theta$ some constant
- $y$ is the output of the model
